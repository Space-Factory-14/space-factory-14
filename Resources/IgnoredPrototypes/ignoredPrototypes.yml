# This is a basic list that specifies files for which the prototypes inside of them will be made abstract.
# This supports all prototype kinds and is intended to allow servers to remove prototypes in a relatively clean way.
# This method does not break inheritance, but you will still have to remove usages.

# e.g., you can specify both directories and specific files by adding lines like:
#
# - /Prototypes/Guidebook
# - /Prototypes/Catalog/uplink_catalog.yml
 - /Prototypes/Maps/atlas.yml
 - /Prototypes/Maps/bagel.yml
 - /Prototypes/Maps/box.yml
 - /Prototypes/Maps/cluster.yml
 - /Prototypes/Maps/core.yml
 - /Prototypes/Maps/europa.yml
 - /Prototypes/Maps/fland.yml
 - /Prototypes/Maps/marathon.yml
 - /Prototypes/Maps/meta.yml
 - /Prototypes/Maps/omega.yml
 - /Prototypes/Maps/origin.yml
 - /Prototypes/Maps/packed.yml
 - /Prototypes/Maps/reach.yml
 - /Prototypes/Maps/saltern.yml
